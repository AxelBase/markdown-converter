  <h1>Advanced Markdown Features for Power Users</h1>
  <p>
    For power users, Markdown offers advanced features that extend its utility beyond basic formatting, allowing for complex content creation. AxelBase supports these features, ensuring seamless conversion to HTML with enhanced functionality and style.
  </p>
  <p>
    Advanced Markdown includes extensions like task lists, tables, and footnotes, which add depth to documents. AxelBase's real-time preview handles these elements gracefully, providing an accurate HTML representation.
  </p>
  <p>Key advanced features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**Tables**: Create structured data with pipe-separated columns, ideal for *data presentation*. AxelBase converts them to responsive HTML tables.</li>
    <li>*Task Lists*: Use - [ ] for unchecked and - [x] for checked items, perfect for *to-do lists* in project management.</li>
    <li>**Footnotes**: Add references with [^1], enhancing *academic or detailed writing* without cluttering the main text.</li>
    <li>*Strikethrough*: Use ~~text~~ for deleted content, useful in *revision tracking*.</li>
    <li>**Definition Lists**: Format terms and definitions for *glossaries* or technical docs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Power users benefit from these features in scenarios like *API documentation*, where tables and code blocks are essential, or *research papers*, where footnotes provide citations. AxelBase's support for these extensions ensures that your advanced Markdown is faithfully rendered in HTML, with clean code and stylistic enhancements. By leveraging these tools, users can create more sophisticated content, improving readability and engagement. AxelBase's intuitive interface makes experimenting with these features easy, helping power users optimize their workflow for maximum efficiency.
