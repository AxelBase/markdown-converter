  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    At **AxelBase**, we prioritize *user privacy* and are committed to protecting your data while using our *Markdown to HTML converter*. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information, ensuring a *secure* and *transparent* experience. As a browser-based tool, AxelBase operates with a *privacy-first* approach, requiring no user accounts or server-side storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Data Collection**: AxelBase does *not collect personal information* such as names, emails, or identifiers. The tool processes Markdown input entirely in your browser, meaning your data remains on your device. When you upload *.md files* or input text, it is handled client-side, and no data is transmitted to our servers. We may collect *anonymous usage statistics* (e.g., feature usage or error rates) to improve the application, but these are aggregated and cannot be linked to individual users.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Cookies and Tracking**: AxelBase uses *minimal cookies* solely for essential functionality, such as maintaining session state during your visit. We do *not* use tracking cookies or third-party analytics that collect personal data. Any cookies used are temporary and expire when you close your browser, ensuring *no persistent tracking*.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Third-Party Services**: If you choose to use the *Buy Me a Coffee* feature, you will be redirected to PayPal, a third-party service. We do *not* store or access any payment information; PayPalâ€™s privacy policy applies to those transactions. Similarly, links to external sites (e.g., blog references) are not tracked by AxelBase.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Data Security**: As a *client-side application*, AxelBase ensures your Markdown and HTML outputs remain on your device. We use *secure coding practices* to protect against vulnerabilities, and our open-source code is regularly audited. However, you are responsible for securing your device and ensuring safe handling of exported files.
  </p>
  <p>
    **User Rights**: Since AxelBase does not collect personal data, there are no accounts to manage or data to request. You have full control over your Markdown inputs and can clear them using the *Clear* button. If you have concerns about usage statistics, contact us at *support@axelbase.com*.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Policy Updates**: We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a *revision date*. This policy was last updated on *October 7, 2025*. By using AxelBase, you agree to these terms. For questions, reach out to us via our *Contact* page.
